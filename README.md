# **My Loves**
## - K-Pop (TREASURE)
> ### TREASURE is a 10-member group consisting of: Choi Hyunsuk, Park Jihoon, Kanemoto Yoshinori, Kim Junkyu, Yoon Jaehyuk, Hamada Asahi, Kim Doyoung, Watanabe Haruto, Park Jeongwoo, and So Junghwan. Two members, Takata Mashiho and Bang Yedam left Treasure due to their personal problems. But whatever happens, Treasure may be 10 in my eyes but 12 in my heart. ##

> ### I could honestly write a whole book as to why you should stan Treasure but to make things short, they are funny, nice, their music and music videos are high quality, they produce and compose their own songs, they are all-rounders, there's a lot but for me, they were the ones who saved my mental health. They were my comfort, and they were my home. ###

## - Cookies and Cream Ice Cream
> ### Cookies and Cream is an ice cream flavor consisting of a vanilla flavor, and chocolate cookies, such as oreos. Honestly this is my favorite flavor because I love the textures that this ice cream flavor holds; the creaminess of the vanilla ice cream mixed with chunky oreos just gah! So good. I'm craving them right now as I am writing this. ##

## - Dark Academia Aesthetic
> ### Dark Academia is a popular academic aesthetic that revolves around classic literature, the pursuit of self-discovery, and a general passion for knowledge and learning. The beauty of the vintage colors with the mix of vintage style plus the sophistication of books are just... *chef's kiss*

## - My Bestie, Precious
> ### Precious, also known as Pia Jamila San Buenaventura, is my classmate in 9th grade, a former clubmate in ADNU Content Creator's Club, and a former classmate in taekwondo and modelling classes. She's the type of person you can say is a "beauty and brains". She has been my best friend since last year but I feel like I've known her since forever, especially that we both have an interest in the KPOP group "TREASURE" makes our relationship even stronger.
