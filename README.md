# *Why you should stan Treasure*
---
## TREASURE is a 10-member group consisting of: Choi Hyunsuk, Park Jihoon, Kanemoto Yoshinori, Kim Junkyu, Yoon Jaehyuk, Hamada Asahi, Kim Doyoung, Watanabe Haruto, Park Jeongwoo, and So Junghwan. Two members, Takata Mashiho and Bang Yedam left Treasure due to their personal problems. But whatever happens, Treasure may be 10 in my eyes but 12 in my heart. ##

> ## Firstly, they are a funny and entertaining group. Some kpop idols look and act too stiff that they don't really spend their life to the fullest, unlike Treasure who enjoys both their idol life and their personal life. ##

> ## Secondly, they produce and compose their own songs. They have composed a lot of songs such as "Jikjin", their hit song, "Hello", their latest song, etcetera. ##

> ### I could honestly write a whole book as to why you should stan Treasure but to make things short, they are funny, nice, their music and music videos are high quality, they produce and compose their own songs, they are all-rounders, there's a lot but for me, they were the ones who saved my mental health. They were my comfort, and they were my home. ###
