# *5 reasons on why you should stan Treasure*
---
## TREASURE is a 10-member group (12 members before) consisting of: Choi Hyunsuk, Park Jihoon, Kanemoto Yoshinori, Kim Junkyu, Yoon Jaehyuk, Hamada Asahi, Kim Doyoung, Watanabe Haruto, Park Jeongwoo, and So Junghwan. They debuted at August 7, 2020 with the song "Boy". Two members, Takata Mashiho and Bang Yedam left the group due to their personal problems. Treasure may be 10 in my eyes but 12 in my heart. ##

> ## Firstly, they are a funny and entertaining group. Some kpop idols look and act too stiff that they don't really spend their life to the fullest, unlike Treasure who enjoys both their idol life and their personal life. ##

> ## Secondly, they produce and compose their own songs. They have composed a lot of their songs such as "Jikjin" and "Hello. My personal favorite would be "Thank You", which is sung by members: Asahi and Haruto. ##

> ## Thirdly, they love their fanbase, also known as "Treasure Makers" or "Teumes" in short. They also care and respect for their staffs and to other people. Each of the members are also really close with each other. I haven't seen such a friendly and close group except for Treasure. ##

> ## Fourth, their Music, choreographies and Music Videos are high-quality. Music is catchy and beautiful, choreographies are great to dance to, and the Music Videos are masterpieces. In my opinion, their best Music Video would be "VolKno" by Hyunsuk, Yoshi, and Haruto, which are the rappers of the group. And "Darari" would be one of my favorite choreographies. ##

> ## And lastly, they saved my mental health. They made me happy whenever I was sad, they made me laugh when I cried, they comforted me whenever I was stressed, and they were honestly my home.

> ### I could honestly write a whole book as to why you should stan Treasure but to make things short, they are funny, nice, their music and music videos are high quality, they produce and compose their own songs, they are all-rounders, there's a lot but for me, they were the ones who saved my mental health. Honestly I cannot find a better Kpop group than Treasure.. ###
